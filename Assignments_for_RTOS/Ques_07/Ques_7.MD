Ques_7: What is the scheduling algorithm used by your RTOS?

Answer: FreeRTOS uses 'Priority based preemptive' scheduling algorithm i.e whichever task 
        have higher priority will execute first. 
        If more than one tasks have same priority then it uses 'Round-robin' scheduling algorithm 
        which is based on fairness policy.
