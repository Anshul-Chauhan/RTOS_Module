Ques_2: What is the mechanism used to make a task periodic for the RTOS you are using? Write a
        program to make a task periodic with periodicity of 500ms.

Answer: For making a task periodic, put it inside an infinite while loop. It will repeat its 
        execution after the provided delay(if any). Execution of a periodic task with a periodicity of 500ms is shown in Ques_2 program.
